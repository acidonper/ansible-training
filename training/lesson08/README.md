# Ansible Vault

Ansible Vault is a security mechanism to protect variables with sensitive information as usernames, password, IPs, etc. This lesson tries to emulate regular use cases around these objects.

In order to understand this lesson properly, a set of steps have been designed to be implemented in the following section.

**ENJOY !!!**

## Steps 

-   Create an inventory file named "inventory" with a group named "myinstance" and your internal instance IP assigned included
-   Create a vault variables file named "vault-vars.yml" in a new folder named "vars" with password "vault" and the following variables:
    -   String variable called "new_user_name" with a name "test01"
    -   String variable called "new_user_pass" with a password "test01"
-   Create a playbook named "vault-playbook.yml" using "myinstance" as a hosts parameter and ``<studentxx>`` as a user. The playbook should use tasks to ensure that the following conditions are met on the managed hosts:
    -   Generate a password hash in sha512 using "new_user_pass" and "123qweasdzxc" secret in a new variable named "new_hash_pass"
    -   Create a new user using "new_user_name" and "new_hash_pass" variables
-   Import "vault-vars.yml" file into the playbook
-   Before running your playbook, run the ansible-playbook --syntax-check  command to verify that its syntax is correct
-   Run the playbook!
-   Test the new user
-   Modify "vault-vars.yml" file to include a string variable named "new_user_secret" with the previous secret content "123qweasdzxc"
-   Modify "vault-playbook.yml" playbook in order to include "new_user_secret" variable instead of then plain text secret
-   Run the playbook!
-   Test the user again
