-   Search and Install Nginx official role located on Ansible Galaxy
-   Install rhel-system-roles
-   Create a folder named "roles" to locate custom roles
-   Create a custom role named "mariadb" which has to implement the following tasks:
    -   Install mariadb-server package
    -   Start and enable mysqld service
    -   Create a database defined in "mysql_database" (* "testroles01" by default)
    -   Include a tasks file named "create_mariadb_user.yml" located in tasks folder. It is necessary to import this task file as many times as the number of users defined in an array variable named "mysql_users" (* At least "test01" by default) using a loop.

        -   Add user with password "password01" and full privileges to both the database named after said user and to "testroles01" database, from `<myinstance_ip>`
-   Create a playbook named "roles-playbook.yml" using "myinstance" as a hosts parameter and `<studentxx>` as a user. The playbook should use tasks to ensure that the following conditions are met on the managed hosts:
    -   Execute custom role named "mariadb" with an array var named "mysql_users" which the following values: test01, test02, test03
    -   Execute nginx galaxy role 
    -   Execute timesync rhel-system-role in order to configure "time.google.com" as NTP server
