## Steps 

-   Create an inventory file named "inventory" with a group named "myinstance" and your internal instance IP assigned included
-   Create a playbook named playbook.yml, using "myinstance" as a hosts parameter and ``<studentxx>`` as a user. The playbook should use tasks to ensure that the following conditions are met on the managed hosts:
    -   Print "It is working" message on group "myinstance"
    -   Print instance settings on group "myinstance"
    -   Create a new user "testplay01" on group "myinstance" using become (root)
    -   Install package "httpd" on group "myinstance" using become (root)
    -   Enable and up "httpd" service on group "myinstance" using become (root)
-   Before running your playbook, run the ansible-playbook --syntax-check  command to verify that its syntax is correct
-   Run the playbook and verify results via curl http://localhost
