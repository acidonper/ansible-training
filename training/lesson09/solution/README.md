# Ansible Conditionals, loops and delegate

## Notes

You can pass a list directly to a parameter for some plugins. Most of the packaging modules, like yum and apt have this capability. When available, passing the list to a parameter is better than looping over the task. For example:

```
- name: optimal yum
  yum:
    name: "{{ list_of_packages }}"
    state: present

- name: non-optimal yum, slower and may cause issues with interdependencies
  yum:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ list_of_packages }}"
```
